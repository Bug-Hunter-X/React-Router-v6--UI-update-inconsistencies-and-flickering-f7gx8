# React Router v6 Navigation Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router v6 involving unexpected UI behavior during navigation.  The issue involves inconsistencies in UI updates and flickering of previous component content.  The `bug.js` file replicates the problem, while `bugSolution.js` provides a fix.

## Problem

When navigating between routes (e.g., from `/` to `/about`), the UI may not update immediately. You might briefly see the previous component's content before the correct component renders. This flickering is inconsistent, making it difficult to debug.

## Solution

The solution involves using `useLocation` hook to manage the routing state.  This ensure that state changes do not introduce unexpected behaviors.
